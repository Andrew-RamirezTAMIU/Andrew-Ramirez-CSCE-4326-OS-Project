Project Title: Operating System Simulator

Description: This project is for CSCE 4326 Operating Systems. The project revolves around creating a simplified operating system simulation using C++. The project will be divided into parts, with each section representing a different part of the operating system. For example, the first portion of the project will represent the shell that handles authentication.

Members: Andrew Ramirez

Instructions for Part 1:
(1) Download or copy the files found in the "Branch" section under "OS PROJ Part1" and look for the main.cpp, auth.cpp, and auth.h of the repository on an IDE. 
(2) This program simulates the login process of an OS with a hard-coded login and password. Type in the correct username and password, "admin" and "password123," respectively. (3) If the username and password were properly input, you will be displayed with a success or failure message.
